#REVIEW#To be succinct, of all the places that I've tried, Banh Mi Saigon has the best Vietnamese sandwiches downtown. Banh Mi Saigon  never gets too packed, which is great if you're on the go. However, if you do wish to dine-in, they do have a handful of seats for you to chomp down on your sandwich. As far as selection goes, they do have the standard spread that you'd find at any banh mi spot. My go to here is the #4 with pate.Price-wise, you're looking at about $6-8 for your sandwich. All in all, it's not  that bad, considering they're giving you a hefty amount of food, and that you're in Manhattan vs. Queens. Banh Mi Saigon's sandwiches keeps me coming back again and again, clamoring for that tasty #4.
#REVIEW#Best Banh Mi's in NYC. I would recommend even making a special trip to eat here - these sandwiches are crunchy, fresh, and delicious to the max. I seriously don't have enough good things to say about this place. You basically get a humongous delicious banh mi for $6.25 (they upped the price), which is IMO a steal. It's CASH ONLY, by the way.I was blown away at how quick my banh mi came, considering that they are all made to order. I handed the cashier the cash, and within 30 seconds he handed me a freshly assembled, warm banh mi.The portion size is HUGE. For starters, you can probably eat half a sandwich and be full. It's loaded with BBQ pork, pickled veggies, carrots, and cucumbers. I recommend getting it spicy. The bread is fresh and crunchy. The veggies are crisp and fresh. The BBQ pork is flavorful. Honestly, just come here. I have nothing but good words to say about this place.
#REVIEW#This is my all time favorite banh mi place in the city. I never go anywhere else besides this place. I love how they redid the place. There is more space to sit. I always get the bbq pork. It's super delicious and it is a big sandwich. I can only finish like half the sandwich since it's way too big for me. They are super fast with the orders, I never had to wait more than 5 minutes for my order. I always end up getting 3-4 sandwiches before I leave the city and they are still good when you heat it up. The price did change since I last time I went there. It used to be something like $5 something but now it's $6.25 for the pork banh mi. But it is definitely worth it!
#REVIEW#So this is like a  Vietnamese macdonalds. You walk in, place your order and within a minute there comes your sandwich. For the price, you cannot beat it. Lots of veggies, a reasonable amount of protein, although i have had better protein choice else where but it was a very filling sandwich. Your basics, crusty bread, veggies and although i asked for jalapeños they forgot them. I go back to try the rest if the menu. Oddly enough you can walk about 3 blocks past bowery between  grand street and christy has a better bah mi but it costs more. The Vietnamese coffee had to much sugar, very little ice, could have been better. Certainly not a coffee worth the price or  calories .
#REVIEW#Today was about 2nd chances..Ha! As a big banh mi addict, I'm on a mission to find my new replacement for my fav banh mi place in the Bay Area. I came to Banh Mi Saigon in January and wasn't impress at all.  I ordered the bbq pork at that time and it was to my liking. One of my friends that I met in NY said I must give it  another try as it's her favorite spot. Okay, why not?I went in and decided to go with the Ham and Pate Banh Mi. This was almost 10x better than the January experience. Since I was a little sick still, I didn't get spicy, which I strongly believe would make this sandwich awesome! I can't say this is my new go to Banh Mi spot yet, but I can say it'll probably be a finalist. PS cash only, and no restrooms here. Plenty of seating to eat prior than rushing off.
#REVIEW#I've had this place bookmarked for so long. After finally trying it, I'm able to understand why it's been titled as one of the best banh mi spots in the area. I split half of the #1 (bbq pork) with my friend, and it was delicious! So flavorful and fresh. There were absolutely no complaints about it. Most of all, that price?! It's almost impossible to find a banh mi for $5.25 anywhere in the city. Banh Mi Saigon is definitely a no-frills joint, but there is still some seating for a quick bite. I'll definitely be back for my banh mi cravings!
#REVIEW#I hate to jump on the Banhwagon of so many other good reviews, but this place really gives its customers incredible Banh for their buck. I know they might Banh Mi fron the establishment if I do, but sandwiches this good at prices this affordable in Manhattan of all overpriced places, makes me wanna get naked with reckless aBanhdon, and whip out my junk and let it all Banhg out.Excellent and very cheap sandwiches here, which are some of the best Vietnamese sandwiches I've had in New York City - if not the best. There is a reason why they have so many reviews and so many of those reviews are good.Less hipster than some of the ones in Brooklyn and along St. Mark's. I've had quite a few of these types of sandwiches in the Chinatown area (and hundreds across the country) and I have to say this one is my favourite in NYC. I actually like it more than the ones I've had in Flushing too - which is surprising.Another great plus is that it's dirt cheap, and some of the employees are pretty friendly as well. Sometimes the line can be long, or the wait for the sandwich can be a few minutes, but then the line is usually long at your mother's brothel as well.Now here's my famous old rap recycled to the tune of Banh Mi Saigon!Yo, I'm Fox and I come from TEHRANI like to have sex while I eat WON TONI do 160 on the AutoBAHNLike Right Said Fred, I'm too sexy for MILANMy Barbie's so hot she could be Miss SAIGONI took her East, they said we couldn't miss SAIGONBut afterwards she said she wouldn't miss SAIGONBut we miss the sandwiches at Banh Mi SAIGONWait I just rhymed a whole verse with "SAIGON"AnywayIf I was in Star Wars I'd be HANIf I was Kirk I'd be the wrath of KHANIf I was Connery (SEAN) I'd be BOND, James BONDAnd like Jerry Maguire, I'm the ambassador of KWANIf I was a Beatle I'd be JOHNIf I was an Eagle I'd be DONIf I was N'Sync I'd be GONEAnd if you want Mi (Banh) go to Banh Mi SAIGON!I'm closer to China than f***ing TAIWANI'm closer to Laos than f***ing VIETNAMOnly thing that comes before "mi" is BANHI been having sex while you been having NONEYou wanna Josh Duggar wit yo sister and yo MOMI f***ed lots of Latin girls, you ain't f***ed JUANIf you did, you'd have a premature ejaculaTIONLike Nic Cage, in 60 seconds you'd be GONEThe biopic about me was screened at CANNESI be friends with Cheadle, you don't know DONI count to a billion, you only count to ONEEvery girl I meet wants to have my SPAWNAny place claiming to be better is a CONSlow start, but ugly duck became a SWANTastes better than the girl I just went down ONAnd her sister, 2 brothers, Uncle and her MOMAnd my Arabic boyfriend named HASSANBanh Mi so good, it's a food phenomeNONMichelle Pfeiffer comes here for Dangerous LIAISONSOwner so rich he got 69 MAISONSI won't eat your muffin if it's got nuts and RAISINSAnd I don't understand how this rhymes with SAIGONI get excited watching you dance to ReggaeTONYou need to cool down, girl, drink this EVIANSkip General Tso's, try Banh Mi SAIGONDamn girl, where's all my baguette GONEYou'll wanna make babies and feed this to your SPAWNYou'll wanna marry Bowie like IMANYou'll make Argentina cry like EVA PERONYou'll keep coming back to BANH MI SAIGONI just f***ed 3 girls to the sounds of AKONMy Dad's from IRAN (but my real Dad's from KRYPTON)He spilled Sriracha on his KORANBut Allah forgave him cuz ALLAH LOVES BANH MI SAIGONIf I was Edward this would be my Bella SWANIf I went Overboard I'd be Goldie HAWNIf I crashed weddings I'd be Vince VAUGHNIf I was Borat I'd be from KAZAKHSTANIf food is the Mafia, SAIGON is the DONForget Neo Anderson, SAIGON is the ONEIf you only eat one sandwich eat BANH MI SAIGONOh sh*t, split ends, need to go to a SALON
#REVIEW#Woww one of the best restaurants in Chinatown. Great baguette texture and perfect ratio of bread to stuffing. Friendly people who work there. They've optimized the logistics so you can barely put your change away before they hand you the sandwich. Its also hot and the veggies are crunchy/ fresh. This is like the opposite of a subway sandwich. Oh yea and its also like 5 bucks in a neighborhood overflowing w tourists. Wish there were more gems like this around.
#REVIEW#EDIT: Just a heads up, the prices did raise by a dollar.I was telling my friend the other day how I haven't had Banh Mi in so long and she recommended this place to me, so here I am. This place is a hidden gem! I wish I discovered this place sooner. I usually go to the Paris Baguette shop across the street for their Banh Mi but the sandwiches at Banh Mi Saigon are delicious beyond comparison. I split their #1 the BBQ Pork Sandwich with my sister and it was just so mind-blowing. The portions are generous, the bread is crispy, the pork is delicious, and the veggies (cucumbers, shredded carrots and radish, and cilantro) are light and refreshing. The service was really quick too! This is definitely the place to go for some authentic Banh Mi. Can't wait to try their Rice Vermicelli!
#REVIEW#I love this place. Its one of the best places to get a bahn mi in the city. Its a no frills place and its tucked inside a jewelry shop but its always packed. My father told me he's frequent this shop since they were on east broadway 20 something years ago. Number 4 is the traditional banh mi and it contains pate. But its delicious so dont be afraid to give it a try. If you want to scale on the familiar side, #1 would be your best choice.
#REVIEW#Banh Mi Saigon is just A-OK.... no seriously I was craving for Banh mi and after reading all the reviews and I thought I check it out. I got the regular bbq pork banh mi which to me as a Vietnamese american I was expecting the grilled pork but I was met with the sweet char siu. It wasn't bad but overall it was just to sweet for my palette. I could only finish half and continued with the other sandwhich with Pate which again was fine but mediocre at best. This was the first Banh mi shop I ever ate at in NY.... is this the best Banh Mi around? I sure hope not. It to a point I might have to make my on Banh mi sandwhiches at home if you yelpers are saying it's good here.
#REVIEW#Since I work so close to Chinatown decided to come grab lunch here on a Friday when I had a bit more of a leisurely day at work.Walked into this place and the banh mi shop is in the back and the front is a jewelry/cell phone store.  Totally reminds me of Paris Banh Mi from back in the day.They're rather busy but super quick especially if you have a small order.  Would definitely recommend placing a larger order over the phone or place it and get out and do some other errands.There's several different types of banh mi options that are basically all under $6.  I ordered the BBQ one which is my favorite.  The sandwich was large and the bread was toasted just enough, not to the point where I was crumbing all over my desk.  Will definitely be returning to try all the other types on the menu. :)
#REVIEW#This is a great place it get a cheap Banh Mi. They also have rice vermicelli dishes as well, which I will definitely try next time! I had the Banh Mi Saigon (bbq pork) and had to share the second half with a friend because the servings are generous! The cilantro, carrots, and cucumber were very fresh and seasoned well. The bbq pork was chopped into small pieces so each morsal of pork was covered in sauce and not a bit of it was dry. Needless to say, it takes cash only! Most of Chinatown mom and pop shops are cash only so bring enough green on hand.
#REVIEW#Not a big fan of the bun at all. It wasn't fresh and tasted stale. Chicken was decent.
#REVIEW#I have walked by this place a million times and never step inside.  My friend brought me in for a snack and I am a fan.  We adjust had some soufflé pancakes few blocks away so we had no room for a sandwich.  We ordered the summer roll and ice Vietnamese coffee.  3 BIG summer rolls for 6.00, what a bargain!  They did not have any already made so when we ordered, they made it fresh.  The roll was wrapped nice and tight with tons of mint, basil and lettuce.  So refreshing and satisfying.  They also gave us 2 sauces and a small hot sauce.  When you are in  the mood for a quick and cheap bite, come here.  Also they have someone there consistently cleaning the small seating area which made the experience even better.
#REVIEW#The best banh mi I've ever had! You can ask for spicy or not spicy and they put a lot of meat and vegetables in there. The portions are large and also very filling, I was almost full after eating the first half.
#REVIEW#The sandwiches here are large, filling, and flavorful and generally roughly $5. A steal! The $12 banh mi sandwiches in the UES can't touch this. What I like about Banh Mi Saigon is they have very quick service, and they also have a multitude of additional vietnamese snack offerings on the sides like traditional honeycomb cookies, big fluffy sesame donuts, and more. Seating can be a struggle but if you're lucky you'll find a little nook and cranny to squeeze into for enjoying your sandwich.
#REVIEW#I love the classic #4, which is the Pork and Pate. Definitely the best Banh Mi shop in NYC because:1. It's packed with meat (and veggies), much more generous than other shops in the area2. Pate is peppered adding tons of flavor3. Cheaper than the other shops in the area ($5.25)Constant flow of customers but they are always quick to make your sandwich. Also, I like the convenient seating against the wall so you can enjoy the sandwich on the go.
#REVIEW#The cashier was straight up rude! I ordered a number 4 with pate but got a lot of pate instead. Since I took a bite, I didn't want to return it or make it a big deal out of it so I came back in to order another one. Oh banana, the cashier got upset and annoyed at me for no reason. I don't know if there was a miscommunication between us or what but he kept pointing at the ham and coriander images on the menu as if I didn't know what pate looks like..... Also, I've tried a lot of different Banh Mi places in NYC and to be honest, Sai Gon Banh Mi isn't that great: the pickle radish smells like soap, the coffee isn't Vietnamese coffee, it's way too much water. Sau Voi's iced coffee is probably the best in NYC! Anyways, I would not recommend this for any of my friend!
#REVIEW#Best banh mi of New York, hands down. It's a no frills place with all my Vietnamese favourites I enjoyed down in Philadelphia (which has an overall better Vietnamese food scene). The bread is everything you could wish for in a baguette -- crispy crust, airy soft inside. I love every flavor they have to offer, but if it is your first time, always go for the #1. It is their greatest hit of meats, and so long as you are an omnivore, it will not disappoint. One HUGE plus about this place, that even now I am thinking about, are their flower cookies. I remember seeing them around Chinatown more often in my childhood, but I had not seen it again until I spent some time in Philly, and now I am happy to see it sold here! This place has quick service, and if you are taking food to go, and you have to rush to your feed the meter on your parking spot, don't worry, if you have five minutes, you have enough time to get a sandwich.
