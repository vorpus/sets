#REVIEW#Wow, what a meal! Starting with the Hamachi ceviche, followed by squid ink popcorn chicken, eggplant with hummus, and seafood stir fry, all topped off with Panna cotta for dessert.A great little treasure in K-town that offers great happy hour specials, too. Look for the huge Karaoke sign outside (one floor above the restaurant) and take the stairs to this hidden gem. Great service and excellent food. This was our second visit and we'll return again.
#REVIEW#This place has such unique Korean food compared to most of the restaurants in KTown that kind of serve the same food over and over again. Everything here has some unique twist or touch to it and all of the foood we ordered was tasty. My friends especially liked the pork belly and the small army stew they ordered (the broth was super unique and delicious!). Also happy hour is super fun here! It's every day from 4-7 I believe (but double check me on this).
#REVIEW#Came here with friend on Wednesday night. It's located on 3rd floor. The atmosphere is cute, and most of the customer are very young.We ordered popcorn chicken, fried mackerel and Brussels sprout It was happy hour time we had popcorn chicken for half price but they didn't have squid ink in it so I think its a different dish Our fav dish was the fried mackerel Light bulb cocktail was not part of the happy hour menu but it tasted good **********I edited my review because I was doing for a free dish since they didn't have dessert on the menu so I decided to tell the truth. Yes they will give you a free dish if you give them five stars review on yelp That's why they have so many good reviews Tips:1.noise level  We literally was yelling because we could not hear 2. They don't accept coins ( we had bills and quarters for tips , but they chased us downstairs said that they don't do coin) It's fine
#REVIEW#Great place to come for happy hour! 4 dollar beers and 4 dollar popcorn chicken that is solid. Nice vibes in ktown.
#REVIEW#Such a fun night with excellent service. We arrived a little bit early for our 615 reservation, and were immediately seated. We ordered the ceviche, the popcorn chicken , the Anytime burger, and the anytime steak. Ceviche so good that we gobbled it up before taking a picture. Burger and chicken were great. Steak was cooked perfectly and cream corn was oh-so good. We'll be back!
#REVIEW#First time coming here and it was great. Located on the third floor sit by the window because it's a pretty view of the street below. The food was flavour food and service was great. :)
#REVIEW#This was a great place to come and eat and hangout with a group of friends. First things first, this place was pretty hard for us to find since we weren't from around New York! Finally, we saw their sign and began walking up the stairs! We had a reservation for our party, and we were seated right away. One complaint: the table was too small for the seven of us!! And, we knew with the amount of food that we would be ordering that our table would be filled up.. Talked to manager to see if we could get moved to another table, but that  didn't happen because it was reserved for another party. The manager did offer us a free appetizer to compensate which was totally fine with us!We ordered the Anytime Burger, Korean Stew, popcorn chicken, Beef Tartare, Mackerel, Brussel Sprouts, and a couple more (see pics). I don't remember waiting too long for the food to arrive, which is always a good thing! The dishes came out one-by-one, and we just began eating.  The Beef Tartare was something else!! I think we ordered another order of that because it was so fkin bomb. Everything else was also very delicious, but I gotta say that the Beef at this Korean spot was dank.We didn't order any soju or anything, but this would be a cool spot to just kick back and pound some soju with some friends. Definitely roll on by if you are trying to have a good time with friends and enjoy some Korean food!
#REVIEW#Amazing time at anytime.  A little hard to find but spacious 3rd floor location.  6-8pm happy hour Sun to Thursday.Service is great.  Food is not authentic Korean but very creative modern korean tapas and flavor is on point.  Worth the calorie count for your cheat day.  Music is a little loud so not for a quiet dining experience.
#REVIEW#Overall, I enjoyed my experience here. The happy hour special is good for the Popcorn Chicken which is originally 13.95 but half off during happy hour so around $7. The Popcorn Chicken was filling, crunchy, saucy and I had to pack some of it. The squid ink made the chicken unique in its look.I also tried the Stir Fried Seafood which was very delicious- slightly spicy, flavorful etc. I didn't like how it came with a huge portion of bean sprouts on the side though as I personally see bean sprouts as more of a garnish.I think the service was possibly a little "aggressive" or they were just overly attentive somehow. We had 1-2 waiters and also the manager so we felt very "watched". The waiter accidentally gave me half off for the stir fried seafood entree and then after receiving the bill, the manager corrected it and said it shouldn't have been half off... that was fine but then he kind of wanted me to throw the waiter under the bus and say which waiter had made the mistake which I wasn't comfortable doing so it was a little awkward.I also wish they gave larger water glasses or provided a bottle of tap water for the table... since the water glasses were small, I felt like I had to call the waiter or busboy over several times during the meal to refill the water.
#REVIEW#Came for a friends birthday. Service is spot on and attentive, and they are accommodating for allergies (me and my friend have nut allergies - BE WARNED that a lot of items have nuts sprinkled on top). Surf and turf stew was really good and had lots of textures and strong flavor!
#REVIEW#Love their happy hour! Half off house beers and wines. Great place to catch up with friends. Food is amazing as well!
#REVIEW#Amazing and great service this is a nice quiet location where all the staff is attentive. Great for big groups even in big events
#REVIEW#***Great service, Delicious appetizers, Lots of seating***The food here is so delicious and I really recommend checking this place out if you're looking to catch up with a friend or two or go on a date. The food is affordable and great serving sizes. Any of their chicken dishes are delicious!
#REVIEW#Smack in the middle of Ktwon. Cute menu with unique items. My favorite was the squid ink popcorn chicken!The price is also decent compared to other K town hof/bar. Perfect spot to pregame with a group of friends!
#REVIEW#Unique take on Korean tapas. We had the beef tartare, burger, steak, and bosssam. All were delicious!
#REVIEW#Just came here for the first time. It hits every mark you want. Good space, good HH food and cheap beer.Can't ask for more than that.
#REVIEW#3.5 stars. I saw this place come up on Yelp so my friends and I decided to come here for dinner. We didn't make a reservation, but luckily we had just beat the dinner rush and got seated right when we got in. The service here is quick and attentive. The entrance can be easily missed, it's the same main entrance as New Wonjo. We walked up the stairs, but there's also an elevator.We ordered the popcorn chicken, ddukkboki, Korean surf n turf and brussels sprouts. Each dish has something unique whether it's the use of squid ink or a dollop of heavy cream. I would recommend all of the above! Anytime is trendy and the food is pretty good. You won't find anything amazing here but it's a good spot for drinks and small eats with friends. I would come back and it's great to have this option in K-town.
#REVIEW#Truly a hidden gem in ktown! Came here with friends and tried a little bit of everything but my favorite was definitely the popcorn chicken and the beef tartare! Definitely recommend giving those a try. The idea cocktails are quite delicious as well!
#REVIEW#Stopped by for a second time on a early Sunday night for their happy hour. Got their popcorn chicken which has interesting topings and generous pieces of chicken, their soup (surf and turf) which was flavorful and full of seafood, and their dokkbuki which is a super interesting take on a comforting classic with a more vibrant twist. The manager also gave us a complimentary dessert for the pride parade that we overlooked from the comfortable restaurant.Would recommend.
#REVIEW#Delicious food that's Korean and fusion. Love the pork belly and noodles with sea snells! Great place to catch up with friends.
