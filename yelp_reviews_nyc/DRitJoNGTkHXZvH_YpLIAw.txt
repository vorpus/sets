#REVIEW#I spent the whole weekend with my family in New York the waiter was excellent with service and he really enjoyed his work he made the experience very enjoyable. For the dinner and appetizer we had the nokotori and the selection of of cheesees. The nokotori was absolutely delicious and for dinner I ordered the tenderloin Tips at medium well and they were delicious with the potatoes and vinaigrette sauce. Altogether my experience was home-warming Andy would definitely do it again.
#REVIEW#Marc Forgione ended up being the toughest meal to judge during my recent trip to NYC.  It had maybe the best food I tasted in town, but the prices were borderline assault.The space is fantastic, and I loved how much space between tables there are in the restaurant.  In some ways, this felt like the biggest reason why everything cost so much money...but, I have to admit, I liked not bumping other tables while walking to/from the bar or the restrooms.  Service was also exceptional, and the friend who picked this restaurant says this is her standout for the neighborhood in that category.The food is really good at Marc Forgione, there's no debating that.  The Laotian sushi was incredible, the halibut was some of the best I've had all year, and the wings were also very strong.  Cocktails were also quite good at the restaurant.But when you drop $367 on a meal for four people, you want that to really be a hit.  In New York?  That's par for the course at a higher-end restaurant, and that's before you start talking about tasting menus.  I'm still in borderline shock that the halibut was $46...like, did the fish land from Tokyo earlier in the day?  The sushi was $16 for four tiny pieces; for a real roll of sushi at this spot, it would have been north of $30.I just write this off as "New York food prices are comically stupid" and move along, but when it really hits you, it becomes clear:  Chicago food is at the same quality level as NYC, but at half to two-thirds of the price.  Sign me up!
#REVIEW#Was looking forward to this dinner forever. But the service from our waiter was so bad. He was incredibly rude. We were a group of 4. We sat for a while without menu's. Then when ordering drinks we asked do you have pinto grigio ? And the waiter said No.He didn't offer an alternative he was short and rude with his response. The entire night he was rude to our guests. They were vegan/vegetarian so had  minimal options so went with small plate rather than an entree and he asked twice what else do you want in an annoyed manner because they were only getting a small plate. Honestly said AND?!?!? In an annoyed tone. I got a seafood dish that was nearly $50 and it had 1 scallop, 2 mussels, bread, and literally that's it. It had great flavor but literally there was hardly any food. We then waited for 30 minutes for our dessert and asked for the check instead and our waiter came up and said his shift was over (thank god) . They should've taken the dessert off the bill for how long we waited, they said some machine broke??? Who knows... they gave us complimentary shots but honestly the service was so bad it was whatever.I was so disappointed and borderline embarrassed I brought our guests here and wish I said something to the waiter. Had a really really bad experience overall.The 2 stars are for the flavor of the food and the ambiance is pretty... candles and rustic. The service however is zero due to our rude waiter. I wish I remembered his name.
#REVIEW#Made an early reservation on a weekday and had a great meal. We shared:+ Lobster toast+ White bean ravioli+ Halibut+ Passionfruit dessert+ German chocolate donut (special)The lobster was great (I think it was like $48, but it's a large portion, so worth it) and I loved the halibut. Chocolate dessert was amazing. Only thing I didn't care for was the passionfruit cake thing, which was sort of gummy. Service was great.
#REVIEW#With a Michelin star, a James Beard Award and the title "Iron Chef," it is hard to believe that Marc Forgione just turned 40. At his eponymous restaurant, Marc Forgione he shows why he has earned so many honors at such a tender culinary age. While Chef Forgione -- scion of Larry Forgione, godfather of New American cuisine -- points out that he was raised in the kitchen of his father's An American Place from the age of nine, it is clear that was only the base that his creativity builds on. Luckily Chef Forgione is only 40 and we can look forward to many years of creative American cooking ahead.
#REVIEW#I have eaten at many of the top Michelin restaurants in NY and Marc Forgione is one of the best. We ordered some things we hadn't tried before, a starter with truffles they're famous for and an fish entree we hadn't tried. Everything was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend this beautiful restaurant.
#REVIEW#Went to Marc Forgione with the expectation I was going to be served the best chicken in the city, which frankly is always dangerous. Easily delivered though. What's great about MF is that it is simple, doesn't break the bank, and just very well done. Great dining without pretence. I have no idea if that is what he was going for but that's what you get. Service was fantastic - seated immediately, drinks came quickly and the guys were attentive throughout, knew the menu and could read us in terms of food sizing. Also made sure we didn't forget what we were taking home. So 5 stars to them. Started with 3 of the starters, which were the sushito, hot wings and Notikori. All great. See pictures attached. Simple food done very well and pretty centric to nyc style taste. The chicken was the key though, comes out on a cast iron tray that it was cooked in. Potatoes are drowned in the trimmings, with the broccoli cooking right there in front of you. The chicken itself was perfectly balanced with the right amount of tenderness and moisture. We didn't have a lot to drink (rare) but the glass of Italian Barolo was a great recommendation. Bill came to 224 including tip and tax. Crazy affordable. Fantastic. Would highly recommend.

#REVIEW#the namesake of iron chef Marc Forgione is a must for carnivores `in the always trendy Tribeca.the interior is dark with subtle lighting. a mixture of rustic and modern touches work seamlessly to create a unique ambiance and vibe for those   looking to feast on an elevated menu in stylish relaxed digs. the restaurant is fairly big. it is superbusy on primetime nights. this is not a quiet place--there's an infectious energy moving from the kitchen and bar to the tables.if you are a fan of food especially steak, go all in here. no toe-dipping--splash into those cocktails and gorge on the dinner menu. go big or go home. the signature cocktails are booz/ily composed and a nice way to start the night...an amuse bouche and the warm rolls with butter will appear soon. if you are lucky, you may get to try the bone marrow app...which was like a bone marrow pizza. crispy bread, umami bone marrow and a layer of savory sauce. unless you are solo-ing dinner (WEIRDO--who eats alone here?!! lol), get the porterhouse to share--so much perfectly cooked meat & seasonal veggies! you can't go wrong with this much steak...mmm meat coma! if you have room, get the freakin' doughnuts! on busy nights, they will run out.service? awesome. the servers here go above and beyond to make sure you enjoy your time at MF.drops mic cuz i'm on a STEAK OUT!i outzzz
#REVIEW#The place oozes style and sophistication... it's warm, dimly-lit lots of candles and perfect cool tunes. I sat on the bar side and had great service.  The amuse-bouche that the chef sent was an everything bagel bite that could be the best thing I've eaten in months. Let's not forget that this is a Iron Chefs restaurant and the quality, style and presentation... along with the delicious combination of flavors I had makes this restaurant easily one of the best in a city full of great ones.  You can go with a group and sit in the communal table side of the bar or go with a date and take one of the corner candlelit tables for one of the most romantic spots in the city.  Everything I tasted inside coming to that kitchen was creatively prepared with high quality ingredients used everything fresh and made on premises. I think if you order any of the meat or pasta dishes you couldn't go wrong.
#REVIEW#I love Tribeca because Marc is here.  (A big fan of this Iron Chef!).  If you want to experience how flavor combinations should taste, this is the place to be. Every plate is one joyride after another.  Not only is the food impeccable, it's presentation is done with simple, classy settings that are unique.  The whole dining experience with the happy black clad waiters are just down right... perfect.  I have actually been here half a dozen times, way before my Yelp days, but am truly happy to give this place the super-5 star rating.  This time, I ventured to let the restaurant take the lead and tried their taste menu.  It was a menu filled with exotic, exquisite flavors from around the world - the Colorado lamb with harissa from Africa was truly heavenly.  The sirracha- flavored buttered sauce accompanying the succulent lobster made my mouth water continually way after they cleared my empty dish.Thank you so much for the amazing dining experience
#REVIEW#A fabulous adventure of a culinary journey.  Every time I go to this place I leave satisfied.  The flavors are delightfully savory, and cooked to perfection.I started the meal off with a watermelon, tomato  and pig ear bacon salad.  The dressing was creamy and paired Perfectly with the sweetness of the tomato and the salty crunch of the chicharrone.The journey continued into the sea with a perfectly prepared halibut en croute with hazelnuts and cauliflower.  The flakiness of the fish pairs well with the hazelnut.For the main course, I had both the beef tenderloin with brandied onion cooked to a perfect medium rare.  It was served with a hollowed out and fried potato with a cream sauce.   I also ordered the chicken under a brick which is served in a pan of boiling butter, broccoli rabe and potatoes to soak up all the goodness. The skin was bite through with a crunch that leaves you wanting another bite.For desert I ordered a frozen cappuccino which was a nice touch with a chocolate ganache s'mores.
#REVIEW#Love to come here and try something new.  Located in a great part of town, try to get here a couple of times a year for birthdays, special occasions or event a work dinner if I can get approval.Always have new things to try on the apps side.  Usually go with a fish entree, the popular chicken dish and a steak for the table and we all share from there.  They tend to have a good mix of new cocktails as well so tend to steer towards tequila or whiskey drinks and wine.
#REVIEW#My boyfriend and I had an amazing dinner here that was definitely unforgettable and we left thoroughly impressed. Everything from the drinks, food to the service was impeccable. My favorite dish of the night was definitely the chicken (obviously) which really lived up to the hype and the lobster chili. The lobster chili had a great kick to it and was so buttery and delicious! That chicken is everything that everyone says it is. It was perfectly tender and moist and complimented perfectly with the potatoes and broccoli. We had leftovers and it was even better the next day. Experience and food was perfect. I will be back!
#REVIEW#My wife and I had a fantastic chef's tasting menu dinner for our anniversary in early June. The staff was wonderful, attentive and knowledgeable. The drinks were amazing as was the chef's menu. I highly recommend everyone dine here, and if possible get seating outside. 5 stars out of 5!
#REVIEW#It was really a mixed experience here that could easily have been 5 stars.  The food was outstanding and definitely exceeded expectations.  Prices are high but this is NYC so you expect it.  We had a major failure in the service department whereby we had a gap of approximately an hour from the time we received our appetizers to the main dish.  Our waiter and the rest of the staff disappeared.  Chicken under the brick was an amazing dish - definitely get this.  Avoid the uni pasta dish - way overpriced and underwhelming.  Another major miss is the ridiculous wine pricing.  Beyond marked up and no real values to be had.
#REVIEW#It could be 5 stars but I'm extremely not happy about the wine list and prices for wine by glasses. There was the only one sparkling wine by glass - cheap rose from Spain. But it costed there $18 per glass and it wasn't a regular American dosage. It was the regular French or Italian measuring (1/3 of regular glass), like three sips. How it could cost $18?!?! And if you want to buy a bottle of sparkling wine you can choose only between Champagne $150-500 per bottle. It's hilarious! But food was delicious. Especially kampachi tartar and halibut.
#REVIEW#Great atmosphere. Fantastic drinks. Really good food. I would put their spicy lobster sauce on a car tire & eat it. Get it on fries or bread instead. Lots of neighborhood patrons. Can see how this could be a go-to place. Lost one star for prices.
#REVIEW#Our experience at Marc Forgione was unbelievable. We went for my birthday and when we got there they had a birthday card waiting at the table and we were given a round of complementary champagne. The service was amazing. Everyone was so friendly and attentive. The food was the best part. We started off with some oysters and the tuna tartare, then we moved onto a pasta dish and a large shareable halibut dish. Everything was packed with flavor and just the perfect portion.Also they sent us a few "gifts" from the kitchen. Our favorite item that we had all night was one of these gifts, the mini everything bagel bites filled with cream cheese. We were so stuffed towards the end, but we did order their donut of the day which was AMAZING. I'm not a big donut fan, but this donut was killer. Overall we LOVED this restaurant and can't wait to come try it out again!!
#REVIEW#I've been a loyal patron for a few years but tonight I opted to share my favorite restaurant with my family. Why the hesitation? My family is a host of self proclaimed culinary critics and they're never satiated.. well not until tonight. Not only was the food exception but the service was untouchable and incomparable. They ran out of the brick chicken and went beyond ordinary measures to satisfy my only birthday request.. plus this meal was complimentary with a cook book. Every dish was the epitome of culinary excellence and dare I say.. orgasmic. I celebrated my birthday at Marc Forgione with the most important people in my life and I can't imagine  ever going anywhere else for another birthday celebration. Thanks to everyone for one of the best birthday memories. Disclaimer: lobster chili will make you fight even your mom for the last tablespoon. The brick oven chicken and the porterhouse will make you disown your family if they dare to take the last piece. The staff makes you feel like you're home and family!
#REVIEW#Marc Forgione is the perfect place for any form of celebration going on in your life. My boyfriend took me to this restaurant for my birthday and from the moment we walked in the door, we had amazing service. We arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation and they let us know that our table was not ready yet but we could wait at the bar. We ordered drinks at the bar to start expecting to have to pay for them separately as some restaurants make you do but they were kind enough to transfer over to our check at our table once we were seated. When we sat down, there was a nice handwritten birthday card waiting at our table. Our waiter also poured us each a complimentary half glass of champagne. To start our meal, we ordered a special that our waiter told us about that was a pureed potato ravioli. It was a bit on the smaller side but still delicious. For our dinner, we decided on the chicken for two which could definitely be chicken for three with how large the portion is. It came out steaming hot and was absolutely amazing. Would highly recommend this and for how much food you get, it is very reasonably priced. To finish our meal, we ordered the 10 minute cookies and they are a MUST if you love chocolate or cookies. This was hands-down the best cookie I have ever had in my life!
