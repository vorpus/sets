#REVIEW#Quick recap: come here if you like seafood. Or food in general. Awesome atmosphere, wonderful service, delicious food. It's not the biggest restaurant so expect a wait or make a reservation during peak hours. Came here to grab a quick bite of "healthier" food and came out pleasantly surprised. Got the seared tuna with greens and mashed potatoes. Heaven. Got here near the end of the day and the bartender not only made us great drinks, but then let us sample some oysters on top of what we had already ordered. All phenomenal. Can not recommend this place enough. Great ambiance, amazing food, and top notch service.
#REVIEW#After hearing tons of people rave about this spot, I've finally decided to give it a try. I've actually been back a second time so that definitely puts this restaurant on the "bring people you'd like to impress to" list. I personally don't eat oysters (I know.... please don't stone me) but nonetheless it is a great freaking deal during happy hours. Additionally, I am someone who doesn't actually like seafood but the seafood here generally gets a thumbs up from me. Octopus is great because it is flavorful and soft. I'd pass on the escargot though, it just wasn't that special. The risotto and fettuccine are amazing, scallops are not dry and flavorful, clams are creamy but also fresh. However, I'd recommend eating these dishes as soon as possible because they wouldn't be as good if they're cold. The only reason why there is a star off is because the space is teeny tiny and wait tune is always long. Since this is a busy spot, service will also be affected in terms of efficiency and quality. But if you don't mind these as much, please make a reservation and enjoy.
#REVIEW#This place is an affordable gem! Perfect for a date night. We went on a Tuesday at 830 pm. I made a same day reservation and was glad I did! The restaurant was 100% full (except for seats at the bar). Our waiter greeted our table and quickly + we started with a bottle of Sav blanc that was perfectly tart and a dozen oysters. Huge selection of east coast oysters at 2.75/ea and a smaller selection of west coast at 3.75. You're on the east coast - get the east coast oysters. The oysters were dope. I'm not gonna pretend like I'm an oyster expert but I asked for small and briney, I got small and briney, and they were great.For the main dishes we had the fish special + surf and turf (medium rare steak and grilled head on shrimp). Because we are both keto-ish, we asked for no potatoes and the server was happy to accommodate by adding more vegetables which was great. The surf and turf was flavored really well, but unfortunately the vegetables were cold. The steak of the day was prepared perfectly - super flakey but didn't have much flavor. The veggies with the fish were also cold and were supposed to be seasoned with a siracha butter but we couldn't find it. The meal ended w complimentary whiskey cake which we took a bite of each (don't tell the keto police) and almost fell out with how moist and delicious it was...or maybe it's Bc of a month w no sugar.4/5 stars - id go back for the oysters and wine, but may skip the entrees as they weren't seasoned particularly well.
#REVIEW#We really enjoyed our dinner! They have fresh oysters and we very well cooked seafood items. This is a little nice place. I love support local business as long as deliver a unique quality !
#REVIEW#Love the seafood! Oyster was amazingly fresh! Scallops cooked to perfection! Warm friendly ambience! Even with people waiting for tables outside the restaurant, we were never rushed by our server. Like to give a shout out to our server Matt, he makes the whole dining experience truly enjoyable! Will be back!
#REVIEW#Sat at the bar and ordered the scallops with mushroom risotto and the fettuccine with clams. The fettuccine was super cheesy and had a healthy dose of olive oil mixed in, if you're into that. The clams on top were tasty and soft. The scallops were really well cooked and not too dry. I could pass on the mushroom risotto -- it was a little dry for me. If deciding between the two, I would go for the fettuccine for sure. I also tried a few oysters + a beer at happy hour and it was a fun experience. If you're there during HH it's a good deal compared to the oyster appetizer price. The meal was topped off with complimentary pound cake, but it was a little dry. If you order right, this place is great. Their specialty shines through in the seafood and not so much the starches :)
#REVIEW#Upstate specializes in seafood, and it's a very casual and intimate spot, allowing me to enjoy fresh seafood without paying exorbitant prices for a hoity-toity environment. We ordered oysters along with a few appetizers and entrees which ranged from phenomenal to mediocre.Oysters: I tried a good sample of both the happy hour East Coast oysters, along with a few West Coast oysters. The Kumamato oysters were good, but I especially liked the Purple Mountain. The Olympia was itty bitty and had an unpleasant texture and flavor to me. It was somewhat rich and mild at the same time. For the East Coast oysters, the Cup Cake ones were big but much too mild. I really enjoyed the Big Rock most of all. It was deliciously briny and flavorful. The accoutrements were simple: crushed horseradish, lemon wedges, cocktail sauce, and vinegar. That's all I need for oysters.Marlin crudo with caviar: Pretty tasty with a bit of black sturgeon caviar, but it was too salty for me.Tuna tartare: This was really delicious, especially when mixed with that sweet and savory sesame ginger reduction. It reminded me of the flavors of traditional poke with more sauciness.Uni: Hands down the best item we tried. Holy moly was it delicious. It came with salmon roe, carrot puree, raw egg, and toast points. Such an explosion of different flavors and textures from the buttery savoriness of the uni (though milder than expected), the fishiness of salmon roe, the sweet lightness of the carrot puree, and the silky richness of the egg yolk. Everything melded perfectly together, and the bread was perfect for sopping up all the sauces and flavors. I would return just to get one of these for myself.Fettuccine with clams: Everyone raved about this, but sadly, it was underwhelming. The pasta, though perfectly al dente, was kind of flavorless. The clams were juicy and flavorful, but there was a surprising amount of sand.Deep diver scallops over mushroom brown rice risotto: While the scallops were delicious and perfectly cooked, the risotto was also kind of bland and underwhelming. Clearly they know their seafood, but their bases leave something to be desired.You get slices of complimentary whiskey pound cake along with your check. Parts were a little dry but it was still a very flavorful, perfectly sweetened cake with just a hint of that whiskey flavor. My friend asked if he could purchase the cake by itself, but no dice.Not everything was a winner, but I sampled enough delicious things to want to come back and try some other dishes. Plus I need another taste of that uni appetizer, stat.
#REVIEW#I am so disappointed. Upstate has been on my list for awhile now, and we finally got over there on date night. It's not even that my expectations were too high, what started out as the perfect dinner and the perfect choice of restaurants, slowly fizzled into a major disappointment.Let's get to the thing that I really liked first, the oysters. That's what put Upstate on our must try date night radar. I'm a bit obsessed with oysters. We ordered a dozen, six from the happy hour options and six from the waiter's recommendations. They were good. I expected something a bit more sensational. These seemed better than most. Just not something I'd race back for again. I didn't even keep the list of which ones were which, I was so less than enthused. With the likes of Cull and Pistol, Crave and, even, Good Night Sonny nearby, there are places that score much higher, even during happy hour.The ambience is pretty cool. It definitely wasn't what I expected, but that's a good thing. Given the minimalist site design and upscale looking menu, I expected something that fit that look. What a delightful surprise to find it more of a neighborhood hole in the wall that served extremely fresh (they don't have a freezer to store things in, so all the food they serve is fresh for that day) and extremely upscale offerings at extremely reasonable prices. For starters we went with the tuna tartar. Delicious.But that's where things started to go astray. What started out as great service, quickly became more blah service. Not bad, not good. Just blah. You could tell he's been there for awhile. More like going through the motions.I ordered the octopus. The hubby ordered the bone marrow with scallops.The octopus was so over cooked, burnt (there's charred for flavor, and charred like the remnants of burned down building) and inedible. Jayson wanted me to send it back. But, I didn't want to go through all of that or be there longer than necessary. I love octopus. I hated this. I couldn't even eat it.The bone marrow was OMG delicious. I'm pretty sure it's now our new obsession.The scallops though, eh. Jayson loves scallops and he was so excited to be going somewhere that had fresh ones. But, it was lackluster.In all, it was just an okay meal, until you realize you spent $100 on food that was either blah or not edible. I don't see racing back anytime soon, at all.
#REVIEW#Waking into Upstate you think it's a small hole in the wall restaurant that only serves burgers and fries. But you would be so wrong. We sat at a high top table and the server came over after a few minutes and asked if anything interesting pops up off of the menu. Being that it was happy hour and they had oyster specials , Jeffrey was in heaven. But we didn't know what type of oysters to get so he helped us choose. We also ordered the tuna tartare, the charred octopus and the bone marrow with seared scallops. The oysters were really good and fresh. There was two of them that were very small and when I went to eat one it just popped down my throat. I thought that was hilarious. Then he brought out the tuna. It was really tasty. Not the best I've ever had but definitely not the worst.  Then for the main course. This was my first time ever having bone marrow. Being that it was with scallops was just a major plus. The marrow was absolutely delicious. It was very buttery and savory. Mix that in with the scallops it was a brilliant combination. His octopus however was not the winner of the night. It was rubbery and charred a bit too much. We didn't even eat half of it. When he came over to ask if we wanted anything else I had said no and he asked how everything was so I told him about the octopus. He said oh ok. Then brought us the check. LOL. All in all definitely try the bone marrow and the oysters. They are both out of this world.
#REVIEW#I've been meaning to try this place out for the last two years. Now it's one of my favourite seafood places. The only downside is that the entire restaurant can fit 30 customers MAX so getting in is quite a challenge. You can either get a reservation, add yourself to the Yelp waitlist, or go there later in the evening around 9pm.I added myself to the waitlist and then the restaurant texted me when the table was almost ready. Luckily there are many bars in the area, so you can stop by somewhere beforehand and grab a drink while you wait. We had the shrimp & uni butter (wonderful), the fettuccine with clams (my favourite), and 6 different types of oysters. You write down the type and number of oysters that you want on the menu and they lay the oysters out in that order. The bartenders and waiters are also super friendly and we felt very welcomed.It may be hard to come back, but I would definitely recommend this to others.
#REVIEW#Awesome cozy little spot in East Village! It gets super crowded on the weekends, so I recommend making reservations a day ahead.We ordered some oysters to start, then monkfish and clams with linguine for our entree's. The food was DELICIOUS, I wish the portions were a little bigger since I didn't want to stop eating!!I definitely savored every bite. I'll be back again soon!
#REVIEW#Loved this spot! It's extremely crowded, I recommend going late or using the waitlist option. Food was wonderful with great oyster recommendations by the bar tender. If I'm ever staying in that area again I would definitely plan to go back. I ordered the grilled octopus for dinner and it was cooked perfectly. Great spot for happy hour or dinner especially for you foodie lovers. Didn't disappoint!
#REVIEW#Upstate is a decent seafood option in the east village. The menu is a crowd pleaser and the happy hour deal is great. The only catch is - the restaurants is small and reservations can be tricky to get. I wouldn't suggest Upstate for a large crew. I've been here a handful of times and have tried most of their menu. Go during happy hour and get all oysters they offer. I'm a huge fan of their escargot and uni dish to start. Their menu changes but of their staples, the fettucine and clams is my favorite entree. It's simple and rich but it's beautifully prepared with al dente pasta. Their most popular menu item is the scallops over risotto - it's good but it's not memorable. The prices are good (most dishes being under $20) so I'd go and try a bunch of items. Not bad for a seafood joint.
#REVIEW#Omg!! Oysters were fresh and delicious!! We also had the gnocchi and tuna tartare. Yum!! It's a tiny place so get there early and or make a reservation. HH was such a good deal and the service was excellent.
#REVIEW#We came here for dinner. Not bad if you like seafood and I do. They have some pretty good oysters. The moo moo was my fav also one of the bigger ones. For appetizers we had the Uni and Tuna tartar. I liked the Uni the best it came with some ikura, onions, carrot purée , and an egg that made the combo mesh all together really well. Our entrees were the Scallops and the octopus. We liked the scallops and the risotto that came with the octopus the best. The risotto that came with the scallops wasn't bad either, had good mushrooms. But the risotto with the octopus had truffle and caviar. For dessert they brought us some pound cake which was delicious. Overall good experience. Make a reservation ahead! Pretty small inside like all NY restaurants.
#REVIEW#Mmmmm so delicious!!! I sat at the small bar and enjoyed their happy hour special (specific oysters (6) and any glass of wine or beer for $12!) as well as a crab cakes and charred octopus. The oysters were amazing and the octopus with the risotto was to die for. The crab cakes were on a bed of mixed greens with a citrusy dressing and were really good, but I would have liked one more than just the two! Also the very thorough bartender gave a sliver of whisky cake at the end of my meal. It was a fitting delicious ending to a great meal.Will definitely be back!!
#REVIEW#Omg my husband and I went there last night .. it scored 4.5 on Zagat ..my husband had explosive diarrhea x3 with lingering cramps  during the night all morning .. I think it was the oysters .. because I was fine ... He alone fell ill during the night ..I Tasted the most of HIS food except the oysters because I am allergic . Overall it was a disappointing experience.. after the oysters which my husband enjoyed but gave him food poisoning.... and crab cake which I thought was ok ( was salty but still tasty ) everything went downhill ! The bone marrow was mushy red undercooked bloody to the extent our waiter himself noticed blood oozing own table and said we did not have to pay for it ! The octopus was charred bitter burnt horrible The Tuna with wasabi mash potatoes was cooked on edges raw in middle bland bland .. and the mashed potato was a smear of purée on the plate . the tuna tartar chunky mushy with too much thickly chopped onions peppers ..bitter Saving grace was The waiter .. he  was kind attentive to extent we did not even complain and just paid bill and left .. when really I wanted to make a big stink ! Smh horrible .. and not cheap either !
#REVIEW#My husband and I had dinner here on our last night in NYC and had the best time! Upstate is a small hole-in-the-wall spot that has amazing appetizers and seafood dishes. We started with some oysters and ended up getting the Island Creek (must try - these oysters are HUGE), the Wellfleet, and the Moonstones. We loved them all! We also had the uni appetizer, which was really unique. For the main dish, we ordered and shared the cioppino, which was really good too. It came with a TON of seafood so we were both stuffed even though we shared it. I thought the sauce was a bit bland, but was still really good when I soaked my bread into it. At the end of our meal, we got to try the whisky poundcake, which was amazing! I could definitely taste the whisky and it went perfectly with the sweetness of the poundcake. Thanks, Upstate, for the perfect meal to the end of our perfect NY trip!
#REVIEW#Came here for oysters happy hour and it didn't disappoint! They have rotating oysters on the happy hour menu, but it's usually 3 different selections. You have to pair it with either a beer or wine in order to get the deal though - so 6 oysters + a beer for $12, or + a wine for $16. It's a pretty small space so make a reservation if possible (they use yelp!).We got a couple of new brunswick, canada, some from prince edward island, canada, and north fork, long island. They all tasted very fresh, but were on the salty side. Our favorite was the new brunswick one - although it was salty, you still get a kick of sweetness at the end the more you chew on it :) The staff also gave us some complimentary cake at the end, that was really nice for new years day!From what I saw other people order (and what my nose was able to smell haha), it all looked pretty amazing. Looking forward to coming back and tasting some real food!
#REVIEW#ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Another limited space restaurant in NYC, I recommend making reservations as there isn't much room to wait inside. We did so via Yelp app. We had reservations at 5 pm, as soon as they opened. The restaurant was immediately filled and within 5 minutes, people were told to expect a 45 minute wait. Their happy hour consists of a beer and 6 oysters for $12. The oysters were fresh and came with 3 toppings/sauces. There's the option to get wine and 6 oysters for $16. I ordered the clam fettuccine and my boyfriend got the ciopinni. His dish came with bread to be dipped in the tomato broth. The amount of seafood he received was plentiful, rich flavor, and fresh. My clam fettuccini was by far my favorite dish from my entire week trip in NYC. Our waiter also gave us a complimentary desert followed by our meal! If you love seafood, I highly highly recommend coming here!! You will not be disappointed and the price is definitely fair!
