#REVIEW#We were a 20 minute walk away checking out some pianos and I realized we were barely a mile away from this place. I was craving pastrami, so we came to this place. It was a long walk and I was dreading the inevitable- that it would be bland and I would've wasted my money and time. I was so wrong.We ordered two things- a pastrami sandwich, and a second pastrami sandwich. The pastrami is RIDICULOUS- it more than lives up to the hype. We were completely full and this was the last chance to get some pastrami, so we forced ourselves to come here, but after the first bite, I was suddenly starving for more. The pastrami is incredibly flavorful in a way that you can't even describe or imagine in this kind of beef. The texture was like butter and the meat quite literally melted in my mouth- an experience I can only say I've also had in wagyu beef. The stack of meat was tall but with the powerful mustard it made an awesome bite and wasn't nearly as filling as I thought. All I can say is- I'm so, so glad that I came. If you have tastebuds, you'll agree.
#REVIEW#Everything was delicious. Portions are excessive and prices are high, so I took a star off. Maybe more reasonable portions might be given for somewhat lower prices?  Anyway, 2nd Avenue Deli serves the best matzoh ball soup in the city, delicious pastrami, and luscious chopped liver. Wait staff was wonderful, and this location is more attractive than the 3rd Avenue branch.  I'll be back!
#REVIEW#Food: 4/5      Price: 3/5      Service: 5/5     Ambience: 5/5*** Michelin Guide 2019 ***While the décor may be more deli-meets-deco and there's a tad less attitude, this food is every bit as good as it was on Second Avenue. This is a true Jewish deli filled with personality, and one of the best around by far. The menu remains as it should: kosher, meat-loving and non-dairy with phenomenal pastrami, pillowy rye, tangy mustard, perfect potato pancakes and fluffy matzo balls in a comforting broth. Pickles and pickled lettuce come complimentary and on the house, both sour and half-sour. Delicious with the sandwiches! Sandwich portions were not too big compared to other places, especially with the steep price. Hot pastrami sandwich ($22.50) - 5/5. Honest opinion, better than Katz's. The pastrami is thinly sliced to give that extra layered effect. Perfect lean-fat ratio. Yum!Hot corned beef ($21.50) - 5/5. Liked this more than the pastrami as it was less salty and had a distinctive smoked flavor.
#REVIEW#2nd Ave Deli is worth going to for the pastrami sandwich. It is savoury and filling. You can ask for different cuts of the meat--fatty, lean, regular. I personally like the lean. It is still rich and tender without being dry. Order a side of coleslaw and French fries and treat yourself to a full meal. If pastrami is not your thing, the chicken schnitzel sandwich is also delicious.I recommend checking 2nd Ave Deli out.
#REVIEW#This place is AMAZ-BALLS I had the corned beef, hot pastrami and soft salami with a potato latke, and it was all beyond delicious! I'm from California where we have our own Jewish Delis such as Langers and Canters but this place puts them all to shame. If your either from NYC or just visiting this place is a must go to, the food and the service are far beyond par. The most was soft and delicious, it basically melted in your mouth, along with everything that I had there. Can't say enough good things about this place.
#REVIEW#Another restaurant gone down the tubes, a complete shadow of their former selves, I'm sorry to say the 2nd Ave Deli's only good thing is their sign.  No way they deserve 4 stars, if I had to bet money I'd say the owners had lost interest and they are just going through the motions.This used to be a real New York institution.  They were on 2nd Ave in the Village and it was the real deal.  The owner was tragically murdered and robbed I believe, and a nephew or something took the place over, and they moved to a decent block on 33 btwn 3rd and Lex.  I'd had heard good thngs. We were a party of 8, we walked in at 11:30 Sunday morning without a rez and they took us right away,  the joint was empty.  Not a good sign. Kim ordered an iced tea, waiter came back and said they were out of iced tea. Huh? What?  Never heard that one before. Not a good sign. The pickles not crisp, the cole slaw meh.  Not sure what happened to these schmucks. The matzoh ball soup was lousy. The matzoh ball bland. the broth was more like cloudy water. Kim ordered the turkey pastrami (no idea) waiter came back and told her they were outta that too. Kim  0 for 2 so far.  The pastrami was slimy and cheap, the mustard watery and cheap, the rye bread just whatever.  Kim ended up with a bagel with lox and cream cheese, nothing special. Everything is expensive which wasn't a surprise, the surprise was how disappointing the food is.  No one at our table said one nice thing about the food. The service was very good, and their logo iconic. Just not good enough.
#REVIEW#Great NY deli food. True rating is 3.5 stars... only 3 or 4 options in Yelp and 4 is too high. I prefer Kosher style, as opposed to truly Kosher (i.e. I like dairy - cheese for sandwiches, real sour cream, etc...). Food quality is great, classic NY deli. Five stars on quality, but a star taken off for the very high prices (even by NY standards). Another star taken off for the less than accommodating, albeit generally efficient service. I'd also recommend coming in a bit after opening or hours before closing for the best possible experience...  if you show up late - the door is open but you get a loud greeting in the form of 'only takeout for the last hour!' Upon entering...  making it seem like even getting to go food would be doing you a huge favor.
#REVIEW#*** JBF America's Classic (1998) *** #23 ***Neighborhood Jewish deli serving up some of the best matzoh ball soup that I've ever had.  They were really nice and suggested splitting one order of soup into 3 bowls so that we could all taste it, but to be honest I would have loved to have an entire bowl to myself! It's a very light soup as there are little noodle pieces vs full noodles and the broth, while very flavorful, is very light, so this can definitely be a starter.We also had the turkey pastrami sandwich with a side of broccoli.  The coleslaw that came on the side was actually the best coleslaw that I've ever had.  I'm not a coleslaw person at all but here it wasn't covered in mayonnaise and I'm not sure exactly what they put on it to give it flavor, but it was exactly right.  Same thing can be said about the broccoli - basically just steamed, yet for some reason extremely flavorful.  There wasn't much to the sandwich - just bread and turkey pastrami - but there was a very generous amount of meat that had enough flavor that it didn't matter that the sandwich was so simple.Bottom line: very simple, but extremely flavorful food all around with amazing service that makes you feel like a regular even if you aren't one.
#REVIEW#Sadly, it feels like this place has gone downhill. There's no love or gusto behind the food like there used to be.  The vibe is stale. The guy behind the counter was taking cash and credit cards while preparing to go orders. Without switching gloves. That's unsanitary.  Touching cash and then touching my food? We could get sick. For the price you are paying here, the food should go through clean hands at the very least.  All in all, food is OK (taste-wise) but overpriced with poor practices. To the owner, please tell your guys to switch their gloves after each transaction or go back to having the register handle all transactions.
#REVIEW#Good selection of typical Jewish deli foods. Very pricey. Not good for a group bigger than two.
#REVIEW#Arrived at 7am and they were open which is super convenient. Food was ok and the service was good. The soup was a little bland but the sandwich was ok. Next time I'll try something different.
#REVIEW#I was in search of the best pastrami sandwich in NYC and 2nd Ave Deli is up there with Katz's Deli! Servings were huge. Had the pastrami sandwich on both rye and challah bread. Daughter was on a keto diet but had the pastrami burger and loved it! We also shared 2 of their potato knish. Complimentary pickles. Overall a great dining experience!
#REVIEW#This was one of my very favorite stops in New York City. We had matzoh soup, potato salad, and a pastrami sandwich. All were absolutely delicious! The staff were so kind and helpful. I unfortunately don't have much experience with Jewish delis, but 2nd Ave Deli felt very authentic and bottom line - so yummy! I would recommend it to anyone.
#REVIEW#We came here when it was pretty quiet. Workday, weekday quiet.That made it seem like a normal neighborhood place, despite its long standing reputation as a tourist destination. We really enjoyed the pickles and cole slaw. They were fresh and crisp and delicious. We were surprised at how very good the Chicken Matzoh Ball is! It was a highlight, to be sure. We enjoyed how crispy the French Fries were and we enjoyed a nice Turkey Sandwich. The Pastrami was good, but seemed like the pastrami you would get at any ol' deli anywhere. I wanted 2nd Avenue to replace the energy, flavors, portions and experience of Carnegie Deli, while avoiding the lines at Katz'. For that, we were disappointed. 2nd Avenue Deli is a good, reliable New York Deli, but not really a destination restaurant.
#REVIEW#I immediately love anywhere that you sit down and you are promptly brought pickles and sauerkraut.  Right from the beginning, I could tell 2nd Ave Deli was going to quench all of my cravings.Of course, I went for the hot pastrami sandwich.  You can choose to order it regular vs. lean vs. extra lean, and they warn you that, the more lean, the less juicy.  Naturally, I went with regular because what good is dry pastrami?  It sure did not disappoint and could easily be two meals.
#REVIEW#Ok but way overpriced.Matsa ball soup - 4/5. Decent flavor but not as rich as other places. Good noodles. But super expensive at $10 for a small soup.Turley sandwich with Russian Dressing - 2/5. Literally a hunk of turkey on bread with a side of Russian dress and mustard. The Russian dressing was tasty but totally not worth $15.
#REVIEW#The birthday lady wanted a delivery of sandwich , dessert samplers and cole slaw. The food was delivered in around 30 minutes, half time than estimated. They fulfilled the birthday lady's request for black white cookies , so it's a plus! Everything else was good.
#REVIEW#We tried 2nd Deli restaurant tonight and got to say was a great experience.  We were greeted upon entrance and seated pretty fast.  Matza ball soups were very yummy.  Ordered the pastrami sandwich along with chicken tenders and grilled chicken sandwich and ofcourse French fries all very yummy.  Service was great. Prices a bit over the norm. Overall a great experience.
#REVIEW#This is really a 3.5 review and it would have been a real 4 but we tried Barney Greengrass deli in the interim, and that knocked it down in our minds. We had the salami omelet which was very good along with fries and toasted challah (yum). The potato knishes we all shared were good - but not at the level of Jonah Schimmel knishes in the Lower East Side. The whitefish salad sandwich was tasty and plentiful on excellent rye bread, and the salami/pastrami sandwich was very good and, of course, huge. Since we don't get good deli in the Bay Area, we enjoyed all of it here our first night in town, but as we tried other places, we found some things were better elsewhere. Appreciated the friendly service, too.
#REVIEW#2nd Avenue is the Pastrami Standard!I grew up visiting NYC as a child, and we try to go back every few years, primarily to eat. For deli we have eaten at Katz's and Carnegie but for us 2nd Avenue is the prefect neighborhood New York City Jewish Deli.Now don't get me wrong. Katz's serves a very respectable pastrami sandwich. I am not a fan of their potato salad, but now I am nitpicking. So did Carnegie before they closed. But 2nd Avenue is a little smaller and a whole lot friendlier. Maybe less tourists -- I am not sure. But it seemed a bit more welcoming, like a neighborhood diner that you've been going to all of your life. At least that is the way they make us feel every time we go.They have all of the your Kosher deli favorites, so if you are not a fan of Pastrami, you poor lost soul, you will be able to find something else. Great egg creams too!
