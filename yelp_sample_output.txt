 I like the atmosphere, food was delicious as I got there on a Sunday. There was a line to the restroom. I don't want to see that number rise for the foreseeable future.
Food: I got the lobster waffle sandwich (slightly tart), and the cheese dip (pale, rich, rich, rich). We shared the cheese dip, which was really good. The lobster bites were not as plentiful, and were only two bites. The lobster waffle sandwiches were delicious and filling, with a wonderful lobster waffle and an extra waffle on top. Service: We were seated promptly and the servers were incredibly polite! We left with our crab sandwiches and some crab waffles, for two. Other than that, nothing too crazy. Overall, this place is one of the best I've ever tried in San Mateo County. It's the size of a normal, quiet town, which gives it a cozy feel. The vibe is extremely casual and relaxed. Definitely worth checking out if you're a lobster person.
I really wanted to love this place because of the food/ service. The lobster waffle sandwich was awesome! And their cheese dip was pretty tasty! I didn't get to try some of the other items because they were all just a taste. All in all, not a bad experience.
Treat yourself and your friends to some incredible lobster bites and lobster cocktail and lobster salad with lobster and other scallops to take home. They are one of the best lobster restaurant in town. We got the fish & chips, lobster scallops, and lobster salad. The fish & chips were the best and the lobster scallops were just right. I also liked that the lobster chips were crispy. A lot crunchier than usual but I don't see that changing any time soon. Lastly, the lobster scallops were also so much flakey and super delicious. They were so juicy and crispy. I definitely recommend this place as a casual, family-friendly, and creative and casual lobster spot. I'll be back again!
Good thing I don't really have to hunt down lobster in order to have good lobster and shrimp and grits... lol. I had to stop to eat. The lobster waffle sandwich was a huge hit. I got the waffle sandwich which was also the lobster scallop. It was my favorite lobster sandwich. I think it is like a sandwich with lobster on it... kind of like a sandwich made all over. It's basically just lobster scallops, fried and grilled. The lobster scallop was just a perfect size to bite off. The grits also were delicious. The scallops weren't too heavy and I could tell how much lobster they cooked it in. It comes with your grits which are also fried. So yum! The best grits from any place in the city and they're all homemade and delicious. Their scallops are very thin and crispy which made me love the scallops. The grits are also super crunchy which is pretty typical. I honestly don't see many grits in NYC. One of the best things they had on the menu was to get one bite of every nook and cranny in the restaurant. I got to try a lot of food which was pretty much lobster, scallop, and seafood. I also got to try the waffle sandwiches which are a big one, but I think I can forgive my high overall praise since I really enjoyed the lobster and shrimp. The lobster waffle sandwich was also good, but overall it was a small portion of lobster and shrimp so I'll have to rework my high review to come up with something else to write about the lobster and shrimp! Overall the staff is friendly and I really appreciate how they keep the waiters on top of guests as well!
This was an amazing experience! The lobster waffle sandwich was so flavorful and delicious (I would have had 3/4 scallops fried and fried all the way through my lobster waffle sandwich). There are 4 to choose from, which I had a hard time choosing. The lobster scallops were my favorite (the scallops were a bit dry). The scallops were crispy and so flavorful I will definitely be back!
This is my first-ever visit to this bar and I was so glad to have it so I can share the restaurant experience it took for me and my friends on this trip to San Mateo and Alameda. The staff was easy to get along with the food was so delicious I can't speak to the quality since I got an unlimited variety of lobster and scallop scallops. I got my lobster and scallop scallops with bacon and green onions. The scallops were also a great pairing of the two scallops. I definitely recommend the lobster scallops since they are so moist and juicy but the lobster scallops were the tastiest part of the meal. I will definitely be back just for the lobster and scall

 and to not include one of my favorite dishes of the evening, the mac and cheese (which was delicious, but would only recommend for the love of cheese). The food was also worth noting, since it went with the wine. It was definitely the highlight of my dinner and I wish the chef would add another dish like that for every dessert, as they're all amazing. I hope they have more to offer, but this was probably my favorite Italian restaurant to go to in NYC. I can definitely see why I have to make a repeat visit with a friend in between trips.
Went with my friends after dinner Saturday night. We only went for two people to start so we just shared. The wine was great and we had to have several glasses. Everything was great and the service was great as well. The only issue we had is we didn't get a chance to try the cheese plate with a fresh mozzarella sauce and fresh basil. Overall it was a great experience. Our servers made us feel welcomed and it really does feel like a home environment. I would think they could have done something to make it even better for us and definitely try something to improve on the last dish I had. Maybe next time.
Came in Sunday for dinner to eat at the bar. It's great because you're eating in the neighborhood, but it's pricey and all you want is your meal. I went for brunch and couldn't order enough food. Came back Monday morning and ordered two bottles of champagne. Ended with tiramisu with the scone and they didn't send it back. No note at all. This is unacceptable. They were also kind enough to take my birthday down but that wasn't my birthday and they gave me a $50 gift card. I'm not a birthday girl, but it should be made possible to send birthday cards outside of the US.
I decided to give this place a try for lunch because it's an established institution and I can't think of another Italian restaurant as good without a great tasting menu. Unfortunately, the food that was served to us was pretty average.  The scallops were just ok and the meat looked a bit skimpy. The garlic bread also tasted like something made at the supermarket.  The garlic bread was also the hardest meat on the plate to chew but also probably what they used to make this menu. And that's when the server was kind enough to give us another one in the next cup of coffee. If there are any other restaurant in this city with bad tasting dishes, I'm sure there would be more of them but this was just the worst.
What's next on the menu? I heard that they have some great Italian food, and I'm going to try it out. It was a little too sweet for our taste, but overall it was just good. The service was great! They were quick and friendly. The environment was very Italian, but relaxed. Overall, this was an excellent experience.
I ordered their scallops and pasta pasta and my wife ordered her appetizer. Our server recommended the Scallops with Parmesan Pasta. The pasta was served in a tiny tupperware dish. The pasta itself felt a tad unappetizing so we were disappointed. We also ordered the pasta with basil and they used olive oil to flavor it, but it was very salty so we are not sure if this is a valid olive oil used. It reminded me of old photographs on the wall and I didn't feel the same fondness for the pasta dishes. It was cooked with a kind of a buttery bread texture and pasta was a bit dry. We just ordered a small bottle of water on our way out and the bottle wasn't filled and the water came out with a small amount. I would definitely not recommend purchasing the bottle, but I didn't find any bad words in them.
My first time at The Villa, it was soooo great! I ordered the Scallops with Pistoletti and it was absolutely delicious. They were cooked perfectly fresh and the sauce was thick and very flavorful. The pasta also got to be my first time eating pasta cooked to-the-bone and it was so delicious! I would really recommend this place! I also had the Bruschetta which was flavorful but it's really light and flavorful. I really can't say enough about it too, but in case anyone else wonders this is it: The Villa is a very small, but absolutely beautiful dining room. It offers spectacular views of the city (if you're into that sort of thing). The food really is worth every penny. Everything from the service to the quality of ingredients was great!I absolutely can't wait to try more of their amazing dishes! My only complaint is that the pasta dish could have been better - I wish they had more marinara sauce!
Great Italian restaurant for two people. They only take reservations and you can make reservations. They do have to book a table before the door on weekends, usually but not always. There

 which I would come back for some food. I ordered to go, but didn't get the pork on it. Instead, they place it on a plate with a little meat so I could add to it. The pork is tasty. It does come out fast, which just means it's on time so I don't need to wait for a refill. The rice was ok too. Their sweet soy sauce sauce made it so the sauce was super creamy. You could taste the sesame seeds in it.
I came here with 2 friends one on a weekend day, and I wanted to find another one.  This place does take reservations, but they don't have a large restaurant like yelp.  So we had to send the food to go. We ordered sushi, pork belly, and ramen! I ordered the pork belly soup ramen, and it was delicious. The broth was thick and it was so flavorful. I ordered it with miso but you can buy your own miso at this location. The rice was fresh and the noodles were great. I will be back to try other on the menu !
Love this place! Always take out food is delicious. Very nice staff! Will have to come back here more often
Came here for the first time with a big group of friends. I'm definitely recommend the vegetarian option on here. It's all you need in a very small and cute size. There's even a non vegetarian option in the back! We were able to order 2 options, and it was all you could afford. There's a great selection of beer and wine on tap, but they have limited beer options so it was more of a Japanese-inspired tap and not a typical American tap wine!They have hot sauce and other dipping sauces which work well. We ordered the pork belly and ramen. Both are really tasty! The pork belly with chili sesame seeds was my favorite. We also ordered a dumpling to share. It wasn't bad, but the biggest fan of the dumpling was the corn on the top. It had corn that was very hard and hard to eat. I really enjoyed that!I ordered the pork belly ramen, which were good, but it wasn't that great. The meat was very tender but lacked the wow factor that many pork belly people are accustomed to. I thought the flavor of some of the other ingredients used on average should be a lot better.It was a very nice evening here! The outdoor seating with picnic benches is definitely a great option. Unfortunately, I found that the tables are not as nice as I would like.  I would rate it less than 5 stars. The servers/waiters were all very polite and very sweet. The food was also amazing. We ordered the pork belly ramen, the beef ramen, the spicy beef ramen, and the pork buns. The ramen were delicious and the beef was a steal! My friend and I also tried the spicy beef ramen. I didn't think I could find a better version of the pork buns. They were a bit hard, but I digress. Our table sat in the corner in a nice little table that you can sit on. Overall the place is nice and romantic with good food! Not too loud, so it's great for the work environment.
Came here for a late lunch during the week to avoid the crowd and meet up with some friends. The place was packed. Very cool ambiance. We ordered the pickle me ramen, spicy ramen, and the spicy dumpling. The pickle me and spicy ramen had good taste of spice, they did have a bit too much sauce. The spicy ramen however was perfectly flavored. I would come back. I will stop by again soon!
This is an up and coming ramen store/chain that has excellent options in the area. The only thing I have to say is it's a bit pricy for a ramen place near midtown like this. We got the pickle me ramen (2 for $5) and their spicy beef ramen. They were both good. Also had their spicy ramen with beef and pork chop. Both were good.We also got some other things like the spicy pork ramen, the chili pork ramen, spicy soy soup, and soy sauce ramen. They are all good options.
It's pretty empty but it's perfect for dates, work pick me!  A bit crowded if you're getting it late, but if you're close and willing you can get by when people are done.They have great selections of lunch specials and dinner specials too.
I recently moved here from LGA and found this place as a great find. The staff was friendly and helpful although it was a little hard to read the time. The food was fresh and tasty! We had the toka bowls and fried rice which was good. They have good lunch specials as well!
This has my very favorite ramen

 week was our last day in the area before we were to head to our nyc dives. We were here with some friends so they were kind of early to let us know that we were not able to get the table right away. We tried explaining to them and I think the owner really liked it! They came around and took the chairs out for us so we could enjoy the place, ate, and then sat us down again. We definitely will be back though we are in the area :)
Had dinner with friends here. Super cozy interior, dimly lit, old wooden paneling, and lovely old posters everywhere. The drinks were super sharp. Great experience at Piazza DeMarco.
This is probably my favorite pizzeria inNYC. I have been so for the past 20 years. The pizza is always cooked exactly how I like- thick straight crust with thin firm middle. The specials are always the best I have ever had. My friends and I go there just to try new pizzeria from Napolitano to Submarinara. The service is always excellent.
Pizza by Anthony was truly incredible, I have been trying to go to this location since the early 80's. I'm so glad I found this place because the restaurant is so small and very intimate. I had not heard of this place until I was a few months ago. This spot is very tight, as there are only 6 tables in total. So you need to know a few names and bring your wallet. We ordered the calamari, pesto mousse pizza, truffle pizza, pepperoni pizza, and the pesto pizza too. You must get the pizza one day, no question. I had no complaints, it was great that I had it before the others arrived. I would go back just to try some other pizza too. My pizza was really delicious, I was surprised. I also had a salad that was good. No naysayers, don't be afraid to try this place out if you get the chance. Also the employees are extremely nice, you don't see that in other places though and the service is very thoughtful.
I can now confirm, with a stuffed animal!  We ordered stuffed peppers, crab cake and a few more pies, and all was well!  The crab cake was our favorite, as it was lightly salted.  The pizza was well made, the crust not really crispy, but still very well done.  We are now so happy we tried this location, it feels intimate. The prices are a little high, and all indications are that it will increase over time.  Still a great stop while you are in the theater district.
I think Anthony Bourdain would agree that PizzA is where life is. Not only is PizzA a treasure in Times Square, but it's a must-visit in the theater district as well. The line move quickly and are always friendly. It's imperative you make a reservation because at #10 you can see the theatre number of the next show that's showing. The food is consistent and the slices are never small. The "Pizza" was very good, but the slices are so huge you can see the lines start to form around the corner.
Excellent pizza by the super-thin crust, crispy and almost chewable thin crust I have had. The crust here is excellent and the service is also impeccable. The "Pizza De Marco" is delicious and so are the slices of pizza. Pizzeria Marco has become my favourite place to get a full glass of wine, or even just appetizers with a great price!
Not my style of pizza but Pizzeria Marco is known to be great and will remain so.Food was very good and well prepared, the slices are huge for only $6! Great deals on wine and pastas for NYC trips! Good value and I would recommend bringing a date and the pizza to impress them!!
Cute little hole-in-the-wall spot for Italian food!I didn't know what to expect but it's pretty small, and even more so in the late evening, where it becomes loud and crowded and people are here to just hang out instead and eat.It is open late and I came here on a weekday afternoon. Inside is dimly lit, and there is a single, round bar that fills up by the time you leave.On the other side is a little waiting area/living room with only a few tables and chairs. They have pizzas and a bunch of different types of pizza, both full or half and you can choose how thick your crust is. I went with my pizza half thick which was just full of cheese and half peppers. Pretty good balance to it! I ordered one cocktail which was the Spicy Mangog cocktail which was well mixed. Service was excellent and very attentive. The pizzas are really good, I usually stick with the $4+ variety, but here it is $8+ for a size medium and

 when the staff can do a better job of explaining the menu items. It may be easier to get a little of everything into a yakitori, but at least a fair amount of it is required for the yakitori. My advice to the diner is to order what you can finish within a given time allotment. I didn't enjoy the yakitori, but I didn't dislike either the food or the service at all. Another thing I would recommend is a set meal with one or two dishes. At the very least, have an A5 wagyu, uni, or saffron with the yakitori set up. This way you get a full portion of all the above without breaking the bank.My personal favorite dishes are the udon (steak), pancake, and broiled salmon. I'd definitely come back to try their broiled salmon.
A great yakitori place in midtown! Great place for groups 4 or less, it's spacious enough for about 30 people total, and it doesn't have too many side dishes :) My friend and I came on a Tuesday at 6pm to test it, and it was really crowded at all! Luckily, there was only 1 other couple in the restaurant, so we were seated right away. It was quick, and the yakitori was so so so good! It was spicy, yet so mild, perfect for me. I really like how the waitress constantly checks on the food, and if it's done right, it's delicious. The service is quick and efficient, and there's a good amount of seating in the restaurant. It's not *quite* as good as One57 or Akasaka, for sure.But I really recommend a go-to place for sure :)
I'm not too familiar with Japanese go karoshi, so I had to learn the hard way that there's something you can't get at every go karoshi anywhere else. This restaurant is tiny, and their go karoshi is always on of the smaller variety. This goes back to the fact that every tiny little place has to be unique. Even the servers speak Japanese, which makes getting ahold of this restaurant any easier. I'd give it a shot, and if it turns out to be just "another go-to" restaurant, that'd be cool too. Otherwise, 4/5 stars.
I went here for my sisters birthday. It was the sister's day, so we decided to go. I highly recommend this place. The waitress was so nice, and they have amazing drinks. The broiled salmon was delicious. It was a little on the small side but still delicious. We had onion around our salad (not on the menu, but they offered it), smoked salmon, and chicken skewers. Our favorite was the chicken skewers!! I would definitely recommend this place. The skewers were hard and cold. The salmon wasn't cooked hard enough, which was a bummer. Everyone enjoyed their skewers. I didn't get to try any of the other dishes. The server had a lot of details wrong, but they seemed to know exactly what she was talking about. The table was a bit crowded and I had to sit almost immediately afterwards.
This is my favorite go karoshi spot in NYC. It has become a regular that I've been to the place multiple times and it's always been a great experience. The food has always been amazing and the vibe is always fun. Last night we got a repeat of the smoked salmon, I've never had better smoked salmon. Even the server was kind enough to point out the improvements. Last night the server made sure to take it a little further with the chicken. The chicken is still the to go item, but I've always enjoyed it. The location is pretty small and it could take a long time to get your check. It's popular with locals and people who just want a drink during their lunch or dinner break. People that work in Midtown are very happy to have it there. The ambience is great too, very clean and orderly. Last night I got there at 11:30pm, my friend was still there yet he found me sitting at the bar area. He was very happy to have me there. The service is great too, the bartenders are nice and helpful. I've only recommended this place for the smoked salmon.
What a find!! We found it on a Friday night & the restaurant was half empty at this time.  Although I found their cocktails to be somewhat watered down, overall we found that they do offer a good selection of musings on whiskey and whiskey/spirits. We started with the Fried Chicken & Waffle, which comes waffle on the side. The chicken was crispy and the batter was well executed. My one critique of the chicken is that the thigh doesn't quite fit between the waffle and the table, though the thighs should help with this.  Overall a good find. I have to say that their buffalo
