 I like the atmosphere, food was delicious as I got there on a Sunday. There was a line to the restroom. I don't want to see that number rise for the foreseeable future.
Food: I got the lobster waffle sandwich (slightly tart), and the cheese dip (pale, rich, rich, rich). We shared the cheese dip, which was really good. The lobster bites were not as plentiful, and were only two bites. The lobster waffle sandwiches were delicious and filling, with a wonderful lobster waffle and an extra waffle on top. Service: We were seated promptly and the servers were incredibly polite! We left with our crab sandwiches and some crab waffles, for two. Other than that, nothing too crazy. Overall, this place is one of the best I've ever tried in San Mateo County. It's the size of a normal, quiet town, which gives it a cozy feel. The vibe is extremely casual and relaxed. Definitely worth checking out if you're a lobster person.
I really wanted to love this place because of the food/ service. The lobster waffle sandwich was awesome! And their cheese dip was pretty tasty! I didn't get to try some of the other items because they were all just a taste. All in all, not a bad experience.
Treat yourself and your friends to some incredible lobster bites and lobster cocktail and lobster salad with lobster and other scallops to take home. They are one of the best lobster restaurant in town. We got the fish & chips, lobster scallops, and lobster salad. The fish & chips were the best and the lobster scallops were just right. I also liked that the lobster chips were crispy. A lot crunchier than usual but I don't see that changing any time soon. Lastly, the lobster scallops were also so much flakey and super delicious. They were so juicy and crispy. I definitely recommend this place as a casual, family-friendly, and creative and casual lobster spot. I'll be back again!
Good thing I don't really have to hunt down lobster in order to have good lobster and shrimp and grits... lol. I had to stop to eat. The lobster waffle sandwich was a huge hit. I got the waffle sandwich which was also the lobster scallop. It was my favorite lobster sandwich. I think it is like a sandwich with lobster on it... kind of like a sandwich made all over. It's basically just lobster scallops, fried and grilled. The lobster scallop was just a perfect size to bite off. The grits also were delicious. The scallops weren't too heavy and I could tell how much lobster they cooked it in. It comes with your grits which are also fried. So yum! The best grits from any place in the city and they're all homemade and delicious. Their scallops are very thin and crispy which made me love the scallops. The grits are also super crunchy which is pretty typical. I honestly don't see many grits in NYC. One of the best things they had on the menu was to get one bite of every nook and cranny in the restaurant. I got to try a lot of food which was pretty much lobster, scallop, and seafood. I also got to try the waffle sandwiches which are a big one, but I think I can forgive my high overall praise since I really enjoyed the lobster and shrimp. The lobster waffle sandwich was also good, but overall it was a small portion of lobster and shrimp so I'll have to rework my high review to come up with something else to write about the lobster and shrimp! Overall the staff is friendly and I really appreciate how they keep the waiters on top of guests as well!
This was an amazing experience! The lobster waffle sandwich was so flavorful and delicious (I would have had 3/4 scallops fried and fried all the way through my lobster waffle sandwich). There are 4 to choose from, which I had a hard time choosing. The lobster scallops were my favorite (the scallops were a bit dry). The scallops were crispy and so flavorful I will definitely be back!
This is my first-ever visit to this bar and I was so glad to have it so I can share the restaurant experience it took for me and my friends on this trip to San Mateo and Alameda. The staff was easy to get along with the food was so delicious I can't speak to the quality since I got an unlimited variety of lobster and scallop scallops. I got my lobster and scallop scallops with bacon and green onions. The scallops were also a great pairing of the two scallops. I definitely recommend the lobster scallops since they are so moist and juicy but the lobster scallops were the tastiest part of the meal. I will definitely be back just for the lobster and scall
